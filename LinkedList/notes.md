A singly linked list contains a set of nodes
Nodes have a value and a pointer to the next node in line
the first node is the head and the last node is the tail
Difference between array and linkedlist is arrays are indexed

Prepend O(1)
Append O(1)
lookup O(N)
Insert O(N)
Delete O(N)

A pointer is a reference

A doubly linked list also links to the node before it

Singly vs Doubly:
Singly needs less memeory
Appropriate to use when memory is expensive and you want to do fast insertion and deletion

Doubly linked list can be traversed from the front or the back
When you want operations like searching and when you have memory
